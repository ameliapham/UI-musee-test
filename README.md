My take on Kevin Pham's [awesome design](https://dribbble.com/shots/14281766-Ancient-Art-Museum-Landing-Page).

## Getting Started

There are a problem with yarn, we need to do:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
git clone https://github.com/barvian/musee](https://github.com/ameliapham/UI-musee-test.git)
cd UI-musee-test
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
(If the default port 3000 is already in use by another application, the server will choose port 3001 : [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001))
